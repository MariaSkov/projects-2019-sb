# Dataproject

In our dataproject we investigate data from FIFA on all World Cup matches from 1930 to 2014. We analyse different statistics in order to answer the question: Who has been the all time most successfull coach in the World Cup? 
We end up concluding, that the German coach Joachim Loew has been the most winning coach in World Cup history, with 15 wins out of 18 games, and one gold medal.
